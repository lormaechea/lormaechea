### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is LucÃ­a and I specialized in the field of Natural Language Engineering thanks to the Master's Degree in <em>Traitement Automatique des Langues</em> at INALCO (Paris), from which I graduated last September.

During the last few months, I did my internship at the <em>Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble</em> (LIG), within a project focused on Automatic Speech Recognition applied to the medical field. I am currently continuing my training and will soon be embarking on a new professional adventure.

Feel free to contact me for any further information ;)
